**- Dataslab**
>A palm-sized computing device that can unfold into a thin slab roughly one-third of a meter on a side. It can perform all the functions of a compad or handheld computer and can communicate wirelessly with nearby devices. (enc. 1)

**- Laser Pistol:** 
>-1 to hit, 1d6 dmg, rng 100/300, mag 10, ash or sand cloud applies up to a -4 to hit and halves range., TL 4

**- Line Shunt**
>These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift color to blend with its surroundings. One or more line shunts must be applied at specific locations within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not need to be directly in contact with a data line but only within a few centimeters. Line shunts are single-use, and keep functioning until removed. (enc. -)

**- Metatool**
>This wrist-mounted housing contains a myriad of small, useful tools designed to handle the widest possible range of technical needs. While a metatool is too limited to handle major jobs, it is usually sufficient to manage jury-rigged repairs and temporary fixes until the tech has time to apply a larger wrench to the problem. (enc. 1)

**- Power Cell, type A**
>One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, power cells are small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold electrical charges. Type A cells are usually used for personal equipment, and the larger type B cells for vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for the cells is substantially different, and they cannot be exchanged or recharge each other without a trained tech's modifications or a converter unit. Power cells can be recharged off a ship's power plant or other grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell. (enc. 1 for 3)

**- Secure Clothing**
>Secure clothing comes in assorted styles and fashions ranging from casual street wear to haute couture. Normal fabrics and components are replaced with light, flexible armor components that are only slightly hindering to the wearer. Only close tactile examination can distinguish secure clothing from ordinary couture. (enc. 1)

**- Spare Parts**
>This is a general category for a number of small TL4 components and repair materials. While a simple toolkit or metatool is often enough to fix a damaged object, severely broken devices may need replacement parts. Rather than keep a catalog of bits and pieces, a technician can simply bring along one or more units of spare parts, subtracting one whenever the GM decides that a repair effort requires more than existing salvage can support. A unit of spare parts can also be used to jury-rig some basic, uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or fifteen minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill. Such bodged devices rarely last longer than one scene. (enc. 1 for 3)

**- Toolkit (Postech)**
>Containing a wide range of necessary tools for a particular skill set, toolkits can handle almost any job that doesn't require a full-scale shop or lab. A standard postech toolkit can handle electronics, small welding jobs, and basic repair on ordinary TL4 goods. (enc. 3)

**- Unarmed attack:** 
>-2 to hit, 1d2 dmg, Unarmed attacks always add the attacker's Punch skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons., TL 0

## Foci

**Hacker-1**
>You have a considerable fluency with digital security measures and standard encryption methods. You know how to make computerized systems obey you until their automatic failsafes come down on your control.
>Level 1: Gain Program as a bonus skill. When attempting to hack a database or computerized system, roll 3d6 on the skill check and drop the lowest die.

**Tinker-1**
>You have a natural knack for modifying and improving equipment, as given in the rules on page 100.
>Level 1: Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice as many mods. Both ship and gear mods cost only half their usual price in credits, though pretech salvage requirements remain the same.
