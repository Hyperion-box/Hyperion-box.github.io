### Saar Junker | Mechanic | Dreamer with a Habit

Raised in the rust-choked corridors of a dead orbital salvage yard, Mekka learned to weld before he learned to read. Quick hands and quicker talk made him a natural at squeezing life out of dead tech—and a prime candidate for the kind of stimulant-fueled lifestyle that eats away at time, nerves, and relationships.

Now holed up in a backwater asteroid colony, Mekka’s behind on his tab with the wrong kind of people. He scrapes by on freelance repair gigs and salvage dives, dodging debt collectors while chasing the dream that keeps him upright: one day owning a ship of his own and flying clean. Respectable. Sober, maybe. Someday.

But for now, he keeps his head down, his tools close, and his next fix closer.
