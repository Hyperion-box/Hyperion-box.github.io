# Scuzz Bukkit's Backstory

## Early Life
Born in the slums of Moll Primus, Scuzz grew up in the shadow of the planet's prison-industrial complex. His parents were both incarcerated when he was young, leaving him to fend for himself in the harsh streets of the capital city.

## Criminal Beginnings
Scuzz quickly learned that survival meant adapting to the criminal underworld. He started small - pickpocketing, petty theft, and running errands for local gangs. His natural psychic abilities began to manifest during this time, giving him an edge in avoiding detection and sensing danger.

## The Turning Point
A chance encounter with a rogue psychic mentor changed everything. This mysterious figure, known only as "The Seer," recognized Scuzz's potential and began training him in the ways of Precognition. Under The Seer's guidance, Scuzz learned to harness his abilities for more than just survival.

## Current Situation
Now operating as a freelance information broker and occasional smuggler, Scuzz uses his psychic abilities to stay one step ahead of both the law and his criminal competitors. His reputation as someone who "always knows what's coming" has earned him both respect and suspicion in equal measure.

## Personal Goals
- Find out what happened to his parents
- Master his Precognition abilities
- Build a legitimate business empire
- Stay out of prison (preferably)
