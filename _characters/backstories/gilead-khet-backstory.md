### Human | Smuggler 

Years ago, Gilead Khet arranged the covert shipment of experimental nano‑regenerative implants—self‑assembling med‑nanites meant to rebuild damaged organs in factory workers after a reactor breach. The prototypes destabilized once inside living tissue, triggering catastrophic immune collapse and dozens of deaths. Wracked by guilt and furious at the megacorp that rushed the tech to market, Khet abandoned the body‑tech black market and repurposed his smuggling network to run life‑saving supplies instead. 

Now, he’s on a personal crusade to ferry the last batch of vaccines through blockades to the plague‑stricken moon hoping success will bring him closer to atonement.
