**- Backpack (TL 0)**  
>A worn backpack counts as a readied item, though objects stowed inside it still require the usual round to dig free. Characters without backpacks or similar carrying devices might have difficulty justifying the hauling of large amounts of gear. (enc. 1)

**- Knife:**  
>+0 to hit, 1d4+1 dmg, Shock 2pts/AC15, TL 0  
>Small weapons are small one-handed implements no larger than a baton or knife. These weapons are easily concealed in normal clothing, and can even be kept Readied up sleeves or in tailored pockets. Many can be thrown at a range up to 10 meters. (enc. 1)

**- Primitive Hide Armor:**  
>Soft fabric armor covering most of the body, perhaps with a pot helm. Examples include leather jacks, thick hides, and quilted armor. (enc. 1)

**- Primitive Shield:**  
>Shields are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to body armor. Primitive shields are usually of wood or stretched hide, while more modern riot shields tend toward clear plastic. All shields require one free hand to use effectively. Aside from their AC benefit, a shield also renders the bearer immune to the first instance of melee Shock damage they take each round, assuming the shield is effective against the weapon being used. A shield grants as base AC of 13; if the users already has AC 13, it grants +1 AC. (enc. 2)

**- Rations (1 day):**  
>Dried or otherwise preserved foodstuffs sufficient for one day. If water is not otherwise available, add another item's worth of encumbrance for the water necessary for a person's daily needs. (enc. 1 for 3)

**- Rope (20 meters, TL 0):**  
>Basic hemp rope or similar. (enc. 2)

**- Spear:**  
>+0 to hit, 1d6+2 dmg, Shock 3pts/AC13, TL 0  
>Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes, spears, or other obvious implements of war. While they can't be effectively concealed in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they're also more damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they're somewhat less nimble when the wielder needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters. (enc. 1)

**- Unarmed Attack:**  
>+3 to hit, 1d8+2 dmg, Shock 2pts/AC15, 1d6 dmg on a miss (plus any Shock damage), Unarmed attacks always add the attacker's Punch skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons. (enc. 0)

## Foci

**Unarmed Combatant (Level 2):** Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives and guns in the grip of the less gifted. Your unarmed attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to binding up opponents wielding rifles and similar long arms, though you need at least one hand free to do so.

Level 1: Gain Punch as a bonus skill. Your unarmed attacks become more dangerous as your Punch skill increases. At level-0, they do 1d6 damage. At level-1, they do 1d8 damage. At level-2 they do 1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does 1d12+1. At Punch-1 or better, they have the Shock quality equal to your Punch skill against AC 15 or less. While you normally add your Punch skill level to any unarmed damage, don't add it twice to this Shock damage.

Level 2: You know locks and twists that use powered servos against their wearer. Your unarmed attacks count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage.

## Armor Class

AC 14 vs low-tech (TL3 or lower) weapons: Readied Primitive Hide Armor gives base AC 13; Readied Primitive Shield gives +1 AC  
AC 10 vs high-tech (TL4 or higher) melee weapons and all firearms: Unarmored base AC 10; Primitive armor (Primitive Hide Armor, Primitive Shield) does not protect against TL4+ melee weapons and all firearms
