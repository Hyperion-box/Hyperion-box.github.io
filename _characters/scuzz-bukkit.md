**- Armored Undersuit:**  
>An armored undersuit is a skin-tight bodysuit woven of advanced TL4 fibers with exceptional shock-activated rigidity and impact dispersion capabilities. Transparent panels allow for it to be worn with almost any outfit without drawing notice or being detected without a close tactile examination. (enc. 0)

**- Backpack (TL 0):**  
>A worn backpack counts as a readied item, though objects stowed inside it still require the usual round to dig free. Characters without backpacks or similar carrying devices might have difficulty justifying the hauling of large amounts of gear. (enc. 1)

**- Climbing Harness:**  
>A collection of straps, ropes, pitons, and other climbing aids that grant a +1 bonus on any Exert climbing skill test. Using a climbing harness is noisy, and any Sneak skill checks while climbing with one suffer a -2 penalty. (enc. 1)

**- Compad:**  
>One of a host of different hand-held portable communications devices. Most TL4 worlds have global comm coverage, but primitive worlds render these devices useless without a nearby comm server to provide connectivity. (enc. -)

**- Laser Pistol:**  
>+0 to hit, 1d6+1 dmg, rng 100/300, mag 10, ash or sand cloud applies up to a -4 to hit and halves range, TL 4  
>Laser pistols are among the most common type of energy weapon, though pistols are considerably less energy-efficient than rifles. Depending on the tech used in the sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of death or noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light. The phased multifrequency beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud of thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a -4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in half. (enc. 1)

**- Low-light Googles:**  
>These goggles provide a monochrome but serviceable view out to the wearer's normal visual distance, provided that there is any illumination available at all. A type A power cell will operate these goggles for a week. (enc. 1)

**- Metatool:**  
>This wrist-mounted housing contains a myriad of small, useful tools designed to handle the widest possible range of technical needs. While a metatool is too limited to handle major jobs, it is usually sufficient to manage jury-rigged repairs and temporary fixes until the tech has time to apply a larger wrench to the problem. (enc. 1)

**- Monoblade Knife:**  
>-1 to hit, 1d6+1 dmg, Shock 2pts/AC15, TL 4  
>Small weapons are small one-handed implements no larger than a baton or knife. These weapons are easily concealed in normal clothing, and can even be kept Readied up sleeves or in tailored pockets. Many can be thrown at a range up to 10 meters. (enc. 1)

**- Power Cell, type A:**  
>One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, power cells are small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold electrical charges. Type A cells are usually used for personal equipment, and the larger type B cells for vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for the cells is substantially different, and they cannot be exchanged or recharge each other without a trained tech's modifications or a converter unit. Power cells can be recharged off a ship's power plant or other grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell. (enc. 1 for 3)

**- Unarmed Attack:**  
>-1 to hit, 1d2+1 dmg, Unarmed attacks always add the attacker's Punch skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons. (enc. 0)

## Foci

**Connected (Level 1):** You're remarkably gifted at making friends and forging ties with the people around you. Wherever you go, you always seem to know somebody useful to your ends.

Level 1: Gain Connect as a bonus skill. If you've spent at least a week in a not-entirely-hostile location, you'll have built a web of contacts willing to do favors for you that are no more than mildly illegal. You can call on one favor per game day and the GM decides how far they'll go for you.

## Psychic Disciplines & Techniques

**Precognition-1:** Master the ability to sense future events and control probability.

The discipline of Precognition relates to sensing the cascade of future events and reading the achronal chaos of the metadimensional energy that ripples in the psychic's brain. Readings provided by Precognition tend to be focused on the psychic and what they find interesting or important. Matters irrelevant to the seer are unlikely to be noticed, even if they are of critical importance to those involved. More advanced techniques of Precognition can even influence the future, adjusting probabilities by changing or pruning certain metadimensional currents.

The future is not carved in stone. Oracles can be falsified by present action or sheer random chance. When a reading is ambiguous or the future seems uncertain, the GM should simply give the most probable reading for the power as their own judgment recommends.

Precognition is strictly future-oriented. For assorted complex reasons, the past is vastly more difficult to observe with psionic powers, and postcognition is generally considered impossible.

Precogs are generally viewed with considerable unease by the general population. They're not as widely feared as telepaths, but the uncanny powers of foresight they possess can make them difficult company. They can earn very substantial sums of money from those desperate to learn of some future outcome, but the specificity of their visions makes it difficult for them to perceive large-scale future events.

A precog can see a city in flames or a stock market board showing a crash, but even the most powerful can't tell if the conflagration is just a limited local disaster or a planet-consuming catastrophe, nor can they tell if the crash is a temporary pullback in the market or a harbinger of global depression. Many precogs have difficulty dealing with this ambiguity, and some become fixed on personal interpretations of their visions that may or may not play out as they have seen.

### Bending the Future:
Everything a precog sees is provisional. Some outcomes may be so likely as to be nigh-certain, but nothing is truly, absolutely destined. Vigorous activity or simple unexpected chance can skew future outcomes.

This effect is one reason why choirs of precogs have not been more widely exploited by planetary governments. The clearer and more detailed a future outcome becomes, the simpler it is to find the crucial events that can be changed to derail it. The more intense the precognitive focus toward a future event, the more fluid it becomes as fresh readings take into account the countermoves that others have made. Rumors persist of ancient pretech augmentation hardware that can "fix" future outcomes, but most governments lack the resources to even consider such extravagance.

### Core Technique - Oracle:
The precog gains a progressively-greater intuitive understanding of their own future. Each invocation of the Oracle technique requires a Main Action and that the user Commit Effort for the day. Once triggered, the adept gets a single brief vision related to the question about the future that they're asking. This vision is always from their own personal vantage point and never reveals more than a minute of insight, though the psychic processes it almost instantly as part of the power's use.

The GM should answer the question as if the PC were about to perform the act or engage in the investigation pertinent to the question. Thus, if the adept wanted to know what pressing a button would do and the GM knows that it's connected to a bomb, the psychic might get a vision of sudden death. If the bomb were on a time delay that extended past the time horizon of the oracle, however, the psychic might just see a vision of herself waiting patiently, with nothing happening.

Visions should relate to actions and events, not abstract facts. Oracle couldn't tell a psychic who the crime boss of a slum neighborhood is, for example, but it could give a vision of the psychic caught in the next bloody riot and the gang boss who's directing the myriad thugs. It couldn't reveal the name of a security guard, but it could show the seer the impending moment that the next guard patrol will enter the area the psychic plans to infiltrate. Only the most important or significant information is conveyed by the technique, even if multiple events of interest might transpire during the time horizon.

Oracle can only be used on a given question or topic once until the situation changes substantially or a week goes by. The maximum time horizon of the Oracle increases as the adept's Precognition skill improves.

Level-0: One minute into the future.  
Level-1: One day into the future.

### Other Techniques:
**Terminal Reflection-1:**  
The psychic's Oracle power automatically triggers as an Instant action moments before some unexpected danger or ambush, giving the precog a brief vision of the impending hazard. This warning comes just in time to avoid springing a trap or to negate combat surprise for the precog and their companions. If the psychic does not immediately Commit Effort for the day, this sense goes numb and this technique cannot be used for the rest of the day.
