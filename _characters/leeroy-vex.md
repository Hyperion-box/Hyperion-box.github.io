## Class Abilities
**Class Abilities:** Once per scene, a Warrior can either automatically negate a successful combat hit they just received, taking no damage from it, or else they can turn one of their own missed attack rolls into an automatic hit. This versatility makes Warriors exceptionally dangerous enemies in a one-on-one fight, and significantly more likely to survive the gory chaos of a general melee.
