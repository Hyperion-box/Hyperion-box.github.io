<p>* <em>This weapon requires two Main Actions to reload.</em></p>

### Projectile Weaponry

Projectile weapons are by far the most common ranged weapons in human use. Even comparatively primitive worlds can fabricate and maintain such weaponry, and the damage a flying chunk of hot lead can do is often worse than what a clean burst of laser fire might produce. Almost any world of TL2 or higher can provide projectile ammunition. Most sophisticated modern ammunition works even in vacuum conditions.

**Bows** are uncommon weapons in the far future, though some lostworlder barbarians have nothing better. Some sophisticated “conversion bows” use special materials to convert the kinetic energy of the draw into a force field “glazing” around the arrow, improving penetration. Bows can be reloaded with a Move action, or faster if the Gunslinger focus is applied.

**Grenade** users always roll to attack AC 10. On a miss, the grenade lands 1d10 meters away from the target in a random direction. Hit or miss, the grenade then explodes for 2d6 damage to all targets within 5 meters. Victims are allowed an Evasion save for half damage. Targets take 1 less point of damage for each point of AC above 14. Grenades can be thrown with the Exert skill instead of Shoot, if desired.

**Crude pistols** and **muskets** represent the rawest and most primitive forms of gunpowder weaponry, usually makeshift weapons improvised by criminals or the desperate. Reloading a crude pistol or a musket requires two rounds instead of one.

**Revolvers** are quite popular on frontier worlds, as the weapons are extremely reliable and can be repaired and manufactured even by primitive metallurgists. Some revolver variants are specially built to handle atmospheres that would destroy more fragile weapons.

**Rifles** are the mainstays of most TL2 armies and hunters, thanks to their superior range and power. Shotguns are cheaper and more easily manufactured than rifles, and are popular weapons for home defense on the frontier. The statistics given are for shot ammunition. Slug rounds do 2d6 damage and have ranges of 50/75 meters.

**Semi-automatic pistols** trade some of the reliability of the revolver for a larger magazine size. They tend to be the favorite sidearm for locals on planets that lack the harsh conditions or uncertain maintenance opportunities of a frontier world.

**Submachine guns** take pistol ammunition but fire it at a high rate of speed. These weapons can fire in burst mode.

**Combat rifles** are favored by the militaries of tech level 3 worlds, trading some of the often-unnecessary range and penetration of a conventional rifle for a larger ammunition capacity and burst fire capabilities. On more strait-laced worlds, such military weaponry is often illegal for civilians to possess.

**Combat shotguns** are more complicated and temperamental versions of conventional shotguns. These weapons have substantially larger ammunition capacity and are capable of firing in burst mode. Combat shotguns can fire slug rounds just as normal shotguns.

**Sniper rifles** are designed to be exceptionally effective at dropping unsuspecting targets at long range. Aside from the additional effective range of a sniper rifle, any target it mortally wounds via an execution attack will die instantly, with no chance for stabilization. The execution attack must qualify according to the terms on page 52. If the rifle is used outside of such conditions, it has no special qualities.

**Void carbines** are designed for vacuum and zero-gee use, and have essentially no recoil. Their rounds cannot penetrate ordinary ship equipment plating.

**Mag weaponry** involves the magnetic acceleration of metal flechettes, while spike throwers are the shotgun equivalents of these weapons. Mag ammunition is packaged with integral power supplies, so no additional power cells are necessary to fire these weapons.

### Energy Weaponry

While the heavy metal slugs and flechettes thrown by projectile weaponry tend to be more damaging, the lack of recoil for non-Heavy energy weapons makes them more accurate, granting them a +1 bonus to hit rolls. Energy weapons are very popular on more advanced worlds, as a soldier can carry far more ammunition in the form of energy cells than they can carry bullets. Range and accuracy are often superior, though the infrastructure necessary for maintenance and repair of these weapons is substantially higher.

Pistol-sized energy weapons count as one item of encumbrance, while rifles, thunder guns, plasma projectors, and distortion cannons count as two items. **Laser pistols and laser rifles** are the most common type of energy weapon, though pistols are considerably less energy-efficient. Depending on the tech used in the sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of death or noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light.

The phased multifrequency beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud of thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a -4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in half.

**Thermal pistols** and their larger, two-handed plasma projector cousins replace the beam of a laser with a small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. The spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than a laser beam, but do significantly more damage to targets within range and are not affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in operation.

**Shear rifles** are the product of a relatively few functioning pretech manufactories. These weapons use miniaturized grav projectors to create dangerous repulsor fields inside a target, tearing the object apart along perfectly smooth planes. Shear rifles are completely silent in operation.

**Thunder guns** are named for the basso vibrations caused by their operation, a sound that can be felt as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid, randomized disruptions in a target that increase the chance of complete structural collapse. If a thunder gun hits a target with an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher, an extra 1d10 damage is rolled. This bonus damage always applies to inanimate targets.

**Distortion cannons** are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons designed before the Scream. These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the underlying fabric of space to disrupt a target. Provided the wielder can see a target within range or accurately fix its location within one meter, the distortion cannon can ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the gun and its target.
