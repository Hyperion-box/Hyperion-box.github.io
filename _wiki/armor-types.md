### Primitive Armor

The most basic forms of protection, primitive armor includes everything from simple shields to full plate armor. While less sophisticated than modern protection, these armors can be manufactured and maintained with minimal technology.

**Shields** provide a +1 bonus to AC and can be used to block incoming attacks. They are particularly effective against melee weapons but offer less protection against ranged attacks.

**Leather jacks and quilted armor** are the most basic forms of body protection, offering minimal encumbrance but limited protection.

**Metal armors** range from partial protection like cuirasses to full plate armor. While offering superior protection, they are more encumbering and require greater technological sophistication to manufacture.

### Street Armor

Modern personal protection designed for urban environments and everyday wear.

**Warpaint** is a sophisticated nanotech coating that hardens on impact, providing protection without the bulk of traditional armor.

**Armored Undersuits** are lightweight, flexible protection that can be worn under regular clothing.

**Secure Clothing** combines fashion with protection, using advanced materials to provide defense while maintaining a civilian appearance.

**Armored Vacc Suits** provide both environmental protection and ballistic resistance, essential for space operations.

**Deflector Arrays** are the pinnacle of personal protection, using force fields to deflect incoming attacks.

### Combat Armor

Military-grade protection designed for active combat situations.

**Force Pavis** are advanced shields that use force field technology to provide enhanced protection.

**Security Armor** is standard issue for law enforcement and security personnel.

**Woven Body Armor** uses advanced materials to provide protection while maintaining flexibility.

**Combat Field Uniforms** are the standard issue for military personnel, balancing protection with mobility.

**Icarus Harnesses** provide both protection and limited flight capabilities.

### Powered Armor

The most advanced form of personal protection, powered armor combines enhanced protection with strength augmentation.

**Vestimentum** is a lightweight powered exoskeleton that provides significant protection without encumbrance.

**Assault Suits** are full-body powered armor designed for frontline combat.

**Storm Armor** represents the pinnacle of military technology, providing maximum protection and combat capabilities.

**Field Emitter Panoply** is the most advanced form of personal protection available, using multiple overlapping force fields and powered systems to provide unparalleled defense.
