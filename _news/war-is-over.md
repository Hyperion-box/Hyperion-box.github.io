After 41 years and 1 month of relentless conflict, the Galactic War has finally reached its bitter conclusion. The ceaseless cycle of destruction that scorched the worlds of Mentak and Naalu, has at last, been broken. The weapons have fallen silent. The bloodshed is over.

Now, the galaxy watches as a new dawn rises—one heralded by the ascendancy of the Argent Shikrai. Capturing the hopes of a war-weary galaxy, promising a future beyond the devastation.

But peace brings its own trials. The Argent Shikrai face an immediate and monumental challenge: to bring stability to a fractured galaxy and to secure their claim over the true heart of the Empire—Mecatol Rex. 

The Galaxy watches, wary yet hopeful, for the first signs of true change.
