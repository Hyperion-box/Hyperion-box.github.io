Shipping lanes around Moll have become a hotbed of pirate activity, with multiple freighters and outposts reporting raids in the past cycle. The attackers, described as highly organized and well-armed, have left little trace beyond wreckage and missing cargo.

Despite growing accusations, the Mentak Coalition has officially denied involvement, stating that any ships operating in the area are ‘rogue elements with no ties to the Coalition.’ However, sources within the sector suggest that a new faction may be forming from within the pirate ranks, challenging the Mentak's control over the region.
