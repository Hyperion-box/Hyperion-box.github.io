## Overview

The jewel of Arcturus. A large space station ring built around the icy planet draws trade from all around the galactic sector.

## History

Mecatol Rex's has long been the symbolic seat of Imperial authority. Under the now gone Lazax, Imperial rule extended across the galaxy for over 1000 years. When the Lazax took their symbolic power too much for granted trouble stirred up in the Quaan system when Letnev fleets blockaded the system belonging to the Federation of Sol. After war plagued the great houses, the Barony and Federation together turned on the Lazax, bombarding the once beautiful planet into desolate grey wastes.
