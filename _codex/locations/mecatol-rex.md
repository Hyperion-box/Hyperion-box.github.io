> "Of all the planets in the galaxy, no planet was more war-torn than Mecatol Rex. Over the course of only a few years, the planet’s ecology was ravaged by bombardments, its population nearly wiped out, and its green fields blasted into a toxic wasteland."

## Overview

The symbolic seat of power throughout the galaxy. The symbolic seat of power throughout the galaxy. 

## History

Mecatol Rex's has long been the symbolic seat of Imperial authority. Imperial rule extended across the galaxy for over 1000 years, under the once great Lazax. But complacency was their downfall. Trouble stirred when Letnev fleets blockaded the Quaan system belonging to the Federation of Sol. 

As the Twilight War plagued the great houses, the Barony and Federation together turned on the Lazax, bombarding the once beautiful planet into desolate grey wastes.

## The Galactic Senate

Rebuilt amid the ruins of Mecatol Rex, the Galactic Senate stands as a renewed beacon of diplomacy and ambition. Here, factions from across the galaxy gather to debate and enact laws that impact the galaxy. 

One such law that drew the ire of many was the enforced travel ban, restricting the usage of wormholes for movement purposes.

## The Cartographers Office

A relic of the galaxy’s more unified past, the Cartographers' Office remains a repository of stellar charts and forgotten hyperlanes. Though much of its archives have been looted or destroyed, its data banks still hold secrets that could shift the balance of power.

## The Grand Library

One of the few structures spared total annihilation, the Grand Library is a monument to the Lazax's dedication to knowledge. Its halls house ancient records, technological blueprints, and even accounts of species long extinct.
