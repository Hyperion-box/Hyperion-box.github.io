## Overview

With ashen-blue skin and imposing, angular features, the Letnev exude an air of superiority and discipline. Their dark eyes are calculating, often shadowed by severe brows that amplify their cold, commanding stares. Tall and sinewy, they carry themselves with rigid precision, their movements reflecting military training ingrained from birth. 

While their voices are deep and deliberate, their words often carry veiled threats or grudging respect, underscoring their reputation as pragmatic yet ruthless warriors.
