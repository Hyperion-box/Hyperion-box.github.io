## Overview

Everywhere has it's issues, and the galaxy is no different there. It has seen powers rise and fall, wars spanning star systems and millennia. Rulers and powers existing today have forgotten more than they remember, as current alliances and firends were once age-old enemies. Nothing ever stays the same.

## First Twilight War

The First Twilight War saw the rise of the Lazax against a tyranical regime known as the Mahact. Ontologically evil beings who used their power to subjagate and enslave their enemies to do their bidding. Whilst their numbers were few, their powers could bend the minds of those against them.

Finally, the Lazax rose against them and united the galaxy to overthrow their cruel masters. Condemning the Mahact to a planet, only accessable by a hidden gateway that was soon scoured from records in the hopes they would never return. 

The Lazax were victorious in their rebellion, ushering in a 1000 years of peace.

## Second Twilight War

The Second Twilight War began with tension boiling over between the Barony of Letnev and the Federation of Sol, envious of the fortuidous position of the Quaan wormhole and it's trade routes, Barony began a blockade, halting all traffic to and from Quaan, causing suffering for the new-found colony there at the same time.
