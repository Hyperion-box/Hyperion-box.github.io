>“The Naalu were never sealed — not truly. Their biology resonates with psionic frequencies that bypassed the Quiet Veil. But they remembered the wars that came before… so they whispered instead of shouting. Mind-reading. Persuasion. Subtle threads, never more. Never enough to awaken suspicion.”

## Overview

The **Quiet Veil** was an ancient psionic seal, a powerful mental barrier created long before the rise of the major galactic civilizations. Its purpose was to suppress the development of psionic abilities across most species, locking their latent psychic potential deep within their minds. The Veil was an unprecedented artifact, crafted by unknown forces, possibly a long-lost civilization or a force of nature beyond comprehension. It permeated the galaxy, cloaking most species in a state of mental dormancy for millennia.

The **Naalu**, however, were unaffected. Due to their unique neural biology and telepathic nature, the Quiet Veil had no impact on them. They could still access their psionic powers, but they chose restraint, limiting their abilities to subtle telepathy and mind-reading to avoid drawing attention to their exceptional gifts.

The Quiet Veil remained a mystery, its creators lost to history. Most galactic species were unaware of its existence, and those few who learned of it could only speculate about its purpose and the forces behind it. The barrier’s function seemed simple—preventing the dangerous spread of psionic powers and the potential chaos that might arise if every species were to gain psychic abilities.

## Shattering of the Quiet Veil

For centuries, the Quiet Veil remained intact, but a series of unknown events began to unravel it. No one knew what caused the Veil to weaken, there are many theories surrounding the Shattering, that the Veil simply ended, or that some unknown force sought to bring Psychics back in their pursuit of forbidden knowledge.

The **Shattering** was a violent event, occurring when a force—whether a single being, a group, or a cataclysmic convergence—broke through the Veil’s mental barriers. The psychic seal crumbled, and for the first time in millennia, the latent psionic potential of billions of individuals across the galaxy began to awaken. The **Quiet** that had blanketed the galaxy was replaced by a flood of minds reaching out, their thoughts and powers surging with newfound intensity.

The Naalu, who had always lived in the shadow of the Quiet Veil’s repression, felt the shattering more keenly than others. While they had retained their psychic gifts, their long-standing advantage was now challenged as other species began to manifest psionic powers for the first time. The Naalu, once the dominant telepathic force in the galaxy, now faced a galaxy that was waking up to the true power of the mind.

The galaxy at large did not know who or what caused the shattering, but the event reverberated through every corner of the known universe, and its effects were felt in every species, from the peaceful Xxcha to the cold Letnev.

## Emergence of Psychics

With the shattering of the Quiet Veil, psionics erupted across the galaxy. Species that had long been denied their latent potential began to experience phenomena they had never before understood. For some, it was an overwhelming surge of power, a flood of abilities that they struggled to control. For others, it was a gradual awakening, a slow manifestation of psychic skills that grew over time.

The **psychic emergence** has become a defining moment for the galaxy. While some species and factions embraced their newfound powers, others feared them, seeing them as a threat to the natural order. The sudden appearance of psionics has sparked new conflicts and fears, with factions scrambling to harness or control this volatile new force.

For the Naalu, the emergence of psychics was a mixed blessing. While they had retained their powers, they were no longer the sole bearers of psychic knowledge. They watched as new telepaths emerged, with some species tapping into raw, uncontrollable power. The Naalu, ever cautious, have made it a point to seek out and monitor these new psychics, offering both guidance and warning.

The **Shattering of the Quiet Veil** was not just a loss of control over the galaxy's psychic abilities—it was a seismic shift, a fundamental change in the balance of power. No longer could the galaxy’s great civilizations ignore the potential of the mind. The age of psionics had begun.
