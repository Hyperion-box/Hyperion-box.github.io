## Overview

The Saar are small, wiry creatures covered in coarse fur that ranges in colour from russet brown to charcoal gray. Their expressive ears and whiskered faces give them a perpetually curious appearance, though their sharp eyes reveal a calculating edge. 

Agile and resourceful, they adapt quickly to new environments, a necessity born from their nomadic lifestyle. Known for their ingenuity and survival instincts, the Saarâ€™s demeanor is often upbeat but tinged with a fierce independence.
