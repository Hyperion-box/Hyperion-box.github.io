## Overview

The **Naalu Collective** remains one of the galaxy's most enigmatic and unsettling powers. With their serpentine grace, crystalline fleets, and unshakable telepathic unity, they are at once mesmerizing and terrifying. Ancient beyond measure, they emerged seemingly from nowhere during the Twilight Wars, demanding audience with the great civilizations—and unsettling them with ease.

What few know is that the Naalu have long been **immune to the Quiet Veil**, an ancient psionic seal that suppressed psychic potential in most of the galaxy. Due to their unique neural biology, they were not bound by its restrictions. Yet, they **chose restraint**, practicing only subtle mind-reading to avoid scrutiny. This self-limitation, they claimed, was a form of wisdom.

With the **shattering of the Quiet Veil**, the galaxy now trembles as psionic powers awaken in other species for the first time in millennia. While others scramble to make sense of their new gifts, the Naalu watch with unreadable eyes, their subtle advantage diminished, but not undone.

## Society

Naalu society is bound not by laws, but by shared thought. The **Collective Consensus**, a psychic lattice formed through ceaseless mental communication, governs every decision. Dissidents are rare and quickly reabsorbed—or silenced.

Their culture venerates precision, grace, and unity. From birth, every Druaa is immersed in a constant hum of minds, shaping their beliefs and choices. Silence, to a Naalu, is isolation. Privacy, an illusion. It is said that to live among the Naalu is to never again feel alone—and never again be truly oneself.

Despite their communal mind, internal dissent does exist. A handful of Druaa have **defected from the Collective**, shielding their thoughts with forbidden psionic disciplines. These individuals are considered dangerous anomalies, hunted relentlessly by the Collective’s elite mind-killers.

Most of the galaxy fears the Naalu for their **neuro-weaponry**, capable of scrambling thought patterns or instilling terror at will. To challenge them is to fight an enemy who has already **seen your fears laid bare**.

## Notable Figures

- **Q’uesh Sish** – The current leader of the Collective. Tall, red-scaled, and ancient even by Druaa standards, she rules from her crystalline palace in Eershin, speaking rarely and reading minds always. Her presence is equal parts elegance and menace.

- **Alyssh Te’ren** – A rumored defector, Alyssh vanished during the Quiet Veil’s collapse. Whispers suggest they now aid factions seeking to understand psionic potential—or undermine the Collective itself.

- **The Faceless Choir** – A collective of high-psion orators who lead the Naalu in ritual songs. These eerie, harmonic chants are said to keep the Collective’s telepathic field stable… and perhaps open minds to something deeper.

## Notable Cities

- **Eershin** – Capital of Druaa. A city of shimmering crystal towers and fluid architecture, where thought and design blend into living art. Every wall sings with psionic echoes, and even the air hums with knowledge.

- **Tel Maaluk** – Hidden on the industrial moon Maaluk, this grim underworld hub fuels the Collective’s war machine. Off-limits to outsiders, it is also home to **Miashan laborers**, whose origins suggest a deeper, concealed link to the Druaa.

- **The Orbifold Array** – A strange structure orbiting Druaa’s sun, believed to be a psionic amplifier or archive. It pulses with rhythmic thought-signals and may be tied to the Collective’s long-standing resistance to the Quiet Veil.
