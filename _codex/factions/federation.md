## Overview
The Federation of Sol, originating from humanity's birthplace on Jord (Earth), has grown from a defensive alliance into a powerful interstellar civilization. Born from the unification of Earth's nations in response to first contact with alien species, the Federation has evolved into a complex political entity that spans multiple star systems. While maintaining democratic principles at its core, the Federation has developed into a blend of republic and oligarchy, with strong expansionist tendencies under its current leadership.

## Society

Federation society is governed by a tripartite system consisting of the House of the People (elected representatives), the House of Law (hereditary magistrates and appointed judges), and the House of Industry (corporate and plutocratic interests). The High Minister serves as the executive leader, balancing these competing interests while pursuing the Federation's expansionist agenda. 

Following the collapse of the Lazax Empire and the ensuing Twilight Wars, many former Sol colonies drifted away from Jord's influence, developing their own distinct cultures and governments. The Federation now seeks to reestablish its historical connections with these worlds, viewing them as rightfully part of the Sol sphere of influence. This reintegration effort is a central focus of Federation policy, though it often meets resistance from colonies that have grown accustomed to their independence.

Human culture, particularly from Jord, has become a unifying force across Federation territories, with its art, fashion, and cuisine gaining widespread popularity throughout the galaxy. The Federation leverages this cultural influence as a soft power tool in its efforts to bring wayward colonies back into the fold.
