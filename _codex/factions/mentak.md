## Overview
The Mentak Coalition emerged from the ashes of a penal colony on the remote world of Moll Primus. Founded by Erwan Mentak, a former prisoner who led the rebellion against the Lazax governors, the Coalition has transformed from a desperate alliance of exiles into a formidable interstellar power. Known for their unique blend of official governance and state-sponsored piracy, the Coalition champions the cause of the underprivileged while maintaining a complex relationship with galactic authority.

## Society

The Mentak Coalition's society is built on principles of egalitarianism and resistance to tyranny, forged in the crucible of their prison colony origins. Their government is led by the Table of Captains, where each captain represents a historical governorship or newly claimed territory. The position of Erwan's Hand, currently held by Captain Sorthina Chung, rotates frequently to prevent power consolidation.

A defining characteristic of Coalition society is its dual nature: while maintaining an official navy, it also sponsors privateer fleets that operate with considerable autonomy. These privateers follow a code of conduct that emphasizes mercy and moral behavior, often using their spoils to support struggling independent worlds. Service as a privateer is seen as a romantic and prestigious career path, with many young officers spending time in this role before returning to official service.
