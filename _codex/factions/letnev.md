## Overview
The Barony of Letnev is a proud and ancient empire, steeped in tradition and forged in the crucible of relentless conflict. Rooted in the oppressive halls of Arc Prime, the Barony views itself as the rightful ruler of the galaxy—a birthright denied only by the treachery of lesser powers. Driven by an unyielding will to dominate, their fleets carry the weight of centuries of bitterness, ambition, and unrelenting discipline.

## Society

Letnev society revolves around a rigid aristocracy where bloodlines determine rank, and power is hoarded with ruthless efficiency. Nobles vie for influence in the Barony’s ever-treacherous courts, where ambition is both celebrated and punished. The working classes toil in Arc Prime's suffocating depths, kept in line by the Barony’s iron rule.

* Hierarchy: Stratified with a powerful noble elite and an oppressed proletariat.
* Philosophy: Power is an entitlement, earned by strength and cunning, not shared.
* Economic Backbone: Mining operations from Arc Prime and neighboring systems fuel their war machine.

## Military Doctrine

The Barony of Letnev’s military is an instrument of oppression and power projection. Their fleets, heavily armored and bristling with firepower, are designed to crush opposition through sheer might. Victory, to the Barony, is not achieved through diplomacy but through absolute superiority.

* Fleet Composition: Massive warships with an emphasis on durability and firepower.
* Strategy: Attritional battles, blockades, and overwhelming assaults.
