## Overview
The Clan of Saar is a resilient and ancient spacefaring civilization, their history marked by tragedy and perseverance. Having lost their homeworld to time and myth, the Saar have transformed from scattered wanderers into a unified force in the galaxy. Their journey from oppression to independence is a testament to their enduring spirit and adaptability. Today, they thrive in the Jorun Asteroid Field, which they consider their new home, maintaining a formidable fleet and a strong sense of community.

## Society

Saar society is built on unity and shared purpose. Governed by the Council of Captains, their leadership reflects their spacefaring heritage, where ship captains are held in highest esteem. The Saar maintain a highly unified culture, with the phrase "All Saar are one Saar" embodying their collective identity. Their society is fluid, with individuals moving between various clans as they pursue their personal "Calls" - whether as artists, warriors, or explorers. The Saar have adapted remarkably to life in space, showing few negative effects from long-term low-gravity exposure.
