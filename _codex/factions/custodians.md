## Overview
The Custodians are primarily the Winnaran Custodians of Mecatol Rex, who have maintained guardianship of the throneworld since the fall of the Lazax Empire. While they work closely with Xxcha consultants and the Keleres agents, these groups serve in supporting roles rather than as equal partners. The Winnu remain the true authority, with the Keleres serving as their underfunded but elite enforcement arm, and the Xxcha providing diplomatic counsel when needed.

## Society

The Winnaran Custodians form the core of this organization, maintaining the sacred traditions and governance of Mecatol Rex. They have granted limited authority to the Keleres to act as their enforcement arm, though other galactic factions often challenge or ignore Keleres directives when it suits their interests. The Xxcha serve as valued consultants, bringing their millennia of diplomatic experience to bear on complex situations, but they operate independently of their home kingdom.

Despite their limited resources, the Keleres have developed a reputation for effectiveness, often accomplishing their missions through skill and determination rather than overwhelming force. Their agents are carefully selected and highly trained, though they frequently operate with minimal support and must rely on their wits and the grudging cooperation of local authorities.
