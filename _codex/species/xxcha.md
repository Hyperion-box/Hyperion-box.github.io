## Overview

Massive and slow-moving, the Xxcha are heavily built with thick, shell-like plates on their backs and a leathery hide that shields them from harm. Their large, dark eyes convey a serene wisdom, and their deep, rumbling voices resonate with calm authority. 

Despite their imposing stature, the Xxcha are patient and methodical, preferring diplomacy over aggression. However, when provoked, their unyielding strength and resilience make them formidable defenders.
