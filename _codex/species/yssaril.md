## Overview

The Yssaril are diminutive, wiry beings with mottled green skin and sharp, angular features. Their large, glowing yellow eyes are adapted for low-light environments, giving them an unsettling stare. 

Known for their quiet movements and uncanny ability to blend into shadows, they exude an aura of menace despite their small stature. Quick-witted and cunning, the Yssaril excel in subtlety and subterfuge, their sly grins often masking their true intentions.
