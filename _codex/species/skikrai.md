## Overview

The Shikrai resemble sleek, predatory birds stripped of their wings, their frames built for speed and agility. Covered in fine, scale-like feathers that shimmer in muted tones, their piercing, hawk-like eyes miss nothing. Their sharp, hooked beaks and taloned fingers hint at their primal origins, while their graceful movements evoke an almost otherworldly precision. 

Fiercely loyal to their kin, the Shikrai value honor and strategy, often operating with an intense focus that unnerves their opponents.
