## Overview

Golden-maned and leonine, the Hacan stand tall with broad shoulders and piercing amber eyes. Their muscular builds reflect an evolutionary legacy as apex predators, but their smooth-talking charm and poised demeanor define them in modern times. 

Known for their adaptability and keen intellect, they are natural negotiators, balancing a strong sense of pride with an innate talent for forming alliances. Hacan speech is melodic yet commanding, their words often as sharp as claws in any diplomatic arena.
