Faction Overview.
## Faction Abilities
**EDICT** - When you win a combat, place 1 command token from your opponent's reinforcements in your fleet pool if it does not already contain 1 of that player's tokens; other player's tokens in your fleet pool increase your fleet limit but cannot be redistributed.

**IMPERIA** - While another player's command token is in your fleet pool, you can use the ability of that player's commander, if it is unlocked.

**HUBRIS** - During setup, purge your "Alliance" promissory note. Other players cannot give you their "Alliance" promissory note.
