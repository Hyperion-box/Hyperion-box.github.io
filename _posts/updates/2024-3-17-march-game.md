## Post-Game
## Episode I: The March of Empires

<img src="/images/march-game/first-two-obs.png" class="map">
Turn 1 initiated with cautious exploration across the galaxy, setting the stage for unfolding conflicts.

***The Pillage of Yin: Mentak swiftly descended upon the Yin homeworld, pillaging their resources in a brazen display of power.***

## Episode II: The Gathering Storm

<img src="/images/march-game/second-ob.png" class="map">

Turn 2 echoed the quiet hum of expansion, yet beneath the surface, tensions simmered.

Mentak continued to "Pillage," mostly Naaz-Rokha and Yin.

***The Nomad-Titans Pact: Nomad and Titans struck a delicate agreement, reshaping borders and alliances allowing Nomad to camp next to Titan's home system. while Mahact and Titans vied for control over the vital wormhole system Quann.***

### The Quann Missile Crisis

A diplomatic rift emerged as Titans disputed Mahact's claim over Quann. Nomad stoked the flames, urging Titans to assert dominance.

Nomad maintained Titans should expand to Quann to accomodate Nomad expanding into Wellon and Lodor. Mahact claims that Titans made the mistake of permitting Nomad to expand too close to their (Titan's) home, and thus Mahact will not cede control of Quann because of this.

***The Rise of Mahact: Defying Titans' threats, Mahact seized Quann, triggering a standoff as Titans amassed fleets for invasion.***

Mahact maintained that the planet of Quann would remain under their control, with their Flagship holding the system.

Titans began a build-up in fleets around the Quann system, with the intention to invade. Talks were initiated to de-escalate with a trade to exhange use of agents, and a sacrificial Destroyer to be sent to Mahact to fulfill their "Edict" ability at a later stage.

## Episode III: The Unraveling

<img src="/images/march-game/third-ob.png" class="map">

Just when the Quann Missile Crisis was seemingly resolved, tensions flared again when there was reluctance from Titans to send their destroyer, after Mahact fulfilled their side of the agreement. This almost escalated to Mahact sending a fleet in to forcibly take a token from Titans, when Titans agreed to honour the agreement.

Mentak claimed Mecatol, gaining the Custodians point and meaning Agenda would take place.

***Yin's Ambition: Yin maneuvered their flagship towards Mecatol Rex, inviting confrontation***

Nomad built their fleet on the border of Titans, maintaining they were allies.

Naaz-Rokha continued exploring for Relic Fragments and gained Shard of the Throne for a victory point.

*Agenda:*

Alpha and beta wormholes have no effect during movement was enforced, limiting movement for every player to score objectives.

Titans were elected Minister of Exploration, meaning when they gained control of a planet, they gained 1 trade good.

## Episode IV: Betrayal and Retribution
<img src="/images/march-game/first-2vp.png" class="map">

Yin moved their Flagship to Mecatol Rex, with Mentak retreating their fleet away before being blown up.

Nomad betrays Titans by placing a command token on their system to break a ceasefire, Titans responds in kind.

Titan destoys the Yin Flagship by using their PDS' to fire from an adjacent system.

<img src="/images/march-game/turn-4.png" class="map">

*Agenda:*
Custom Agenda: Repeal restriction of movement on wormholes.


## Episode V: Nomad's Gambit
<img src="/images/march-game/second-2vp.png" class="map">

Yin moved their fleets around Mecatol and drew aggression from Nomad, where Nomad destroyed Yin's Flagship yet again at the cost of their own cruisers.

Mahact moves to take Mecatol from Mentak, removing the remaining Mentak units which survived the Yin Flagship.

### Naaz-Rokha Quagmire

Nomad turns their sights to the jungle and enters the Alpha wormhole after the custom agenda to repeal the travel ban passes. Starting a conflict with the Naaz-Rokha in attempts to get near their home system. 

With their Flagship in tow and the bulk of their fleet diverted to this new front, the war should be over quickly.

*Agenda:*
Mahact gained "Minister of War," allowing them to perform an action and remove one of their tokens from the board to then play another turn.




## Episode VI: Clash of Titans
<img src="/images/march-game/third-2vp.png" class="map">

<img src="/images/march-game/turn-6-map.png" class="map">

Titans double down on producing in their home system to bulk up their Warsuns with more fights.

Nomad kicks off with continuing their assault on Naaz-Rokha, narrowly winning to take the planets next to Nomad's home system. Opening up the possibility to score "Rule Distant Lands" by controlling 2 planets next to other players home systems, with Titans being the other player.

Mentak then move to block the Alpha wormhole that Nomad passed through.




Mahact activates "New Albion" and "Starpoint" system above Nomad and uses the "Minister of War" agenda card to remove the token and take another action, to move to Nomad's home system and capture it. Mahact uses fleet logistics to take another action and use Imperial to score Mecatol and "Conquer the Weak" for 3 points. Nomad is now unable to score public objectives.

Titans activates a Mahact system to retrieve their token from Mahact and allow them to attack past Mahact mechs.

Mentak retake Mecatol from Mahact.

Mahact leaves the Nomad home system and moves to "Ang," adjacent, to the protests of Nomad.

### ***The Fall of Nomad: Mahact's strikes left Nomad reeling, while Mahact and Titans fought bitterly for control.***

Titans attacks a Mahact carrier adjacent to Mecatol and takes the "Bereg"/"Lerta IV" system.

Mahact attack this system again to destroy the single cruiser there and gain another Titans token for use with Starlancer (mech).

Nomad continues bombarding and attack Naaz-Rokha before losing ships.

Nomad attempts to rebuild a fleet in the "New Albion" and "Starpoint" system, and suffers a surprise attack from Mentak on this new fleet. Nomad play an action card forcing Mentak to retreat at the end of the combat, despite the Mentak victory.

Titans move their war sun and ships to "Saudor" and destory a Mahact Dreadnought.

Mahact plays "Benediction" and forces the Titans Warsun home fleet to move out of their home system to attack the Nomad carrier which has sat unbothered the entire game. Leaving the Titan home system with no ships in space. Mahact activate the Titan home system and use Light/Wwave Deflectors to move through the Titan fleet from "Ang" and capture the Titan home system, scoring the secret "Darken the Skies." Titans can no longer score public objectives.

Mahact score "Rule Distant Lands" bringing their score to 12.
