Combat is turn-based, consisting of six-second rounds where each character acts in initiative order.

## Actions
During your turn, you can perform various actions:
**• Main Action**: such as attacking or using a skill
**• Move Action**: to move or dodge
**• On Turn Actions**: which are free actions like dropping an item or speaking
**• Instant Actions**: like parrying or using abilities

## Attacking
To make an attack, roll 1d20 and add your Attack Bonus. Compare the total to the target's Armor Class (AC). If you hit, roll for weapon damage, using Dexterity for ranged attacks and Strength or Dexterity for melee attacks. Remember that various modifiers may apply, such as those for distance or cover.

## Common Actions
These include:
• Melee or ranged attacks
• Snap attacks (A rushed attack at a penalty)
• Fighting withdrawal (Disengage from melee without provoking attacks)
• Skill usage (Perform an action like first aid or hacking)

## Injury & Death
If a player character (PC) is reduced to 0 hit points (HP), they become incapacitated and must succeed on saving throws to stabilize. Failing these checks can lead to death. 

Additionally, massive damage, critical injuries, or a lack of immediate medical aid can result in permanent death. Healing is a slow process that requires rest, advanced medical equipment, or professional care.
