**Combat** in *Stars Without Number* is turn-based, with each round representing roughly six seconds of in-game time. During a round, each character acts in initiative order.

## Actions During Your Turn
Each turn, you can take:

- **Main Action**: e.g., attacking, using a skill, activating an item  
- **Move Action**: e.g., running, dodging, taking cover  
- **On Turn Actions**: free actions like speaking or dropping an item  
- **Instant Actions**: reactions like parrying or activating certain abilities, usable outside your turn

## Making an Attack
Roll **1d20 + your Attack Bonus** and compare it to the target’s **Armor Class (AC)**.  
- If the result equals or exceeds the AC, it hits.  
- Roll weapon damage and apply any modifiers (Strength or Dexterity depending on the weapon).  
- Consider modifiers for cover, range, or visibility.

## Common Combat Actions
- Melee or ranged attacks  
- **Snap Attacks**: quick attacks at a penalty  
- **Fighting Withdrawal**: disengage from melee safely  
- Skill checks (e.g., hacking, first aid mid-combat)

## Injury & Death
At **0 HP**, a character is **incapacitated**. They must pass **Physical saves** to stabilize, or risk death.  
Massive damage, critical hits, or lack of treatment can lead to **permanent injury or death**.  
Healing is slow unless aided by medical gear or trained personnel.

## Example Combat: Juno vs. Grakk

**Setup**:  
- *Juno*, a human mercenary with an SMG (AC 15, +3 Attack Bonus, 12 HP)  
- *Grakk*, a savage brute wielding a blade (AC 13, +1 Attack Bonus, 18 HP)

**Initiative**:  
- Juno rolls 1d8 = 6  
- Grakk rolls 1d8 = 3  
→ Juno goes first.

### **Round 1**

**Juno's Turn**  
- She uses her **Main Action** to fire at Grakk with her SMG.  
- Rolls: 1d20 + 3 = 15 → Hits (Grakk's AC is 13)  
- Damage: 2d6 = 7 → Grakk is reduced to 11 HP  
- She uses her **Move Action** to duck behind a crate, gaining light cover.

**Grakk's Turn**  
- Grakk charges forward (Move Action) and swings his blade (Main Action).  
- Rolls: 1d20 + 1 = 12 → Misses (Juno’s AC is 15)

### **Round 2**

**Juno's Turn**  
- Juno decides to **snap attack** (a quick shot with -2 penalty) to conserve her action.  
- Rolls: 1d20 + 3 - 2 = 10 → Misses  
- She uses her **Move Action** to back further away.

**Grakk's Turn**  
- Grakk pursues and attacks again.  
- Rolls: 1d20 + 1 = 17 → Hit  
- Damage: 1d10 = 6 → Juno is now at 6 HP

And the fight continues...
