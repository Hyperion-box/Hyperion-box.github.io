## 1. Effort  
**Effort** represents a psychic’s ability to fuel their powers.  
- Psychics must **Commit Effort** to activate techniques.  
- Effort is typically spent **for the day** or **for the scene**, depending on the power.  
- Some powers require **sustained** Effort, meaning the psychic can’t use that Effort elsewhere until they drop the effect.  

## 2. Committing Effort  
When a power requires **Committing Effort**, it means the psychic is dedicating some of their mental energy to fuel the ability.  
- **For the Day**: This Effort is “used up” until the psychic rests.  
- **For the Scene**: This Effort is only committed for the duration of the encounter or a short time.  
- **For the Round**: Some powers only require Effort to be committed for a single combat round.  

Psychics have a limited **Effort pool**, which is equal to their **highest psychic skill level + 1**.  

## 3. Disciplines and Techniques
Psychics specialize in **Disciplines**, which represent broad fields of psychic power, such as:  
- **Biopsionics** (healing, body enhancement)  
- **Metapsionics** (enhancing other psychic abilities)  
- **Precognition** (seeing the future)  
- **Telekinesis** (moving objects with the mind)  
- **Telepathy** (reading minds, controlling thoughts)  

Each discipline contains **Techniques**, which are specific powers.  
- All psychics start with a **Core Technique** from their chosen discipline.  
- They get **one extra technique per level + their highest psychic skill level**.  
- Higher skill levels unlock **stronger techniques** in that discipline.  

## 4. Psychic Skill Levels and Power Progression
- **Level-0**: Basic understanding, but no real power.  
- **Level-1**: Access to beginner techniques.  
- **Level-2**: Stronger powers, increased versatility.  
- **Level-3**: Advanced powers, reality-warping effects.  
- **Level-4**: Near-godlike control over that discipline.  

## 5. Activation Types
- **Main Action**: Takes up a full action in combat.  
- **Instant Action**: Used reflexively or as a quick response.  
- **On Trigger**: Automatically activates when a condition is met.  

## 6. Psychic Strain and Risk
- Some psychic techniques can **exert strain** on the user, potentially causing mental or physical harm.  
- Overuse of psionics **without resting** can leave the psychic vulnerable.  

## 7. Psychic Training and Multi-Discipline Psychics
- A psychic can train in **multiple disciplines**, but it takes **extra time and XP**.  
- Multi-discipline psychics are more versatile but **progress slower** in each individual discipline.
