In **Stars Without Number**, skill checks are made by rolling **2d6** and adding the most applicable skill modifier. If you do not have any points in a skill and attempt a check, you apply -1. A score of 0 in a skill gets no bonus, while a score of 1 gives +1, etc.

**Aiding a skill check:** If someone wants to help another do a check, they can explain how, and if agreed upon, they can attempt to roll the same check. If it passes, the original player gets a +1 to their check. If the total meets or exceeds the target number, the check is successful.

**Example:** If you have the skill "Pilot: 1", you will get +1 to your roll result.
