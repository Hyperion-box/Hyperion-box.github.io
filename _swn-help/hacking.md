## Basic Requirements

- **Roll**: `Int + Program`
- **Access**: System must be:
  - On a planetary network, OR
  - Physically accessed (plugged-in or line tapped)

## Hacking Time

| Situation       | Time         | Notes                     |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Prepared hack  | Main Action  | Pre-written code/scripts  |
| Standard hack  | 10 minutes   | On-the-fly intrusion      |
| Rushed hack    | Main Action  | +2 difficulty (GM call)   |

## Making the Hack

1. Roll `Int + Program` vs. Difficulty
2. On **Success**, choose one:
   - Gain desired data
   - Control system for `1d4 rounds + Program skill`
3. On **Failure**, immediately roll again:
   - Success = No alert
   - Failure = System raises alarm and traces you

## Difficulty Modifiers

| Modifier                             | Value |
|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Human operator present               | +1    |
| Rushed hack                          | +2    |
| Each extra hack on same system (24h) | +1    |
| Personally set up system             | -1    |
| Standard business system             | +0    |
| Major corp or minor gov             | +1    |
| Major gov / black site               | +2    |

## Line Shunts

- Required to control high-security systems long-term
- Needed for:
  - Pro-level system: 1 shunt
  - Gov/corp system: 2 shunts
  - Black site: 3 shunts
- Placed on internal network junctions
- Use “Answer a Specific Question” to find placement spots
- If installed: control lasts indefinitely until removed

## Data Protocols

- Unknown protocols must be learned:
  - Study local docs (1 day–1 month)
  - Get help from local hacker (Connect check)
  - Access secured hardware
- Cost varies: 1k–10k+ credits depending on secrecy

## Common Hacking Actions

| Action                 | Difficulty | Result                                    |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Answer a specific question | 8      | Short fact or answer                      |
| Get general info       | 10         | Overview or full records                  |
| Copy database          | 12         | All system data (needs time & storage)    |
| Suppress system        | 8          | Temporarily disable (e.g. cameras)        |
| Subvert system         | 10         | Take control (e.g. unlock doors)          |
| Sabotage system        | 10         | Permanently disable. Always alerts system |

## Example

Hack a corp vault door:
- On planetary network = Yes
- Subvert system = Diff 10
- Major corp = +1 → Total Difficulty: 11
- Roll `Int + Program` vs. 11
- On success: Door opens for `1d4 + Program` rounds
- On fail: Second roll to avoid triggering alarm
