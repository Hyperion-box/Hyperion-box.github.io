**Death Saving Rolls** determine whether an incapacitated character at 0 HP stabilizes, remains in critical condition, or dies. Here’s how they work:

**Trigger:** When a PC is reduced to 0 HP, they become unconscious and begin making death saving rolls at the start of each of their turns unless they receive immediate healing or medical assistance.

**Roll Mechanic:** Roll a d20 each turn:
• 10 or higher: The character succeeds.
• Below 10: The character fails.

**Success and Failure Thresholds:**
• 3 successes: The PC stabilizes, regaining consciousness after 1d4 hours (or sooner with medical care).
• 3 failures: The PC dies permanently.

**Critical Rolls:**
• Natural 20: Instantly stabilize and regain 1 HP.
• Natural 1: Counts as 2 failures.

**Interruptions:** If the PC takes further damage while at 0 HP (e.g., from an attack or hazard), they automatically fail one death saving roll. Massive damage equal to their max HP in a single hit results in instant death.

**Stabilization:** Once stabilized, the PC no longer makes death saving rolls but remains unconscious until healed.
