# Space Travel Mechanics

## Interstellar Travel
- **Spike Drives**: Used for faster-than-light (FTL) travel through metadimensional space. 
  - Operable without fully understanding metadimensional physics.
  - Modern drives (TL4) are less efficient than ancient Terran Mandate drives.

### Gravitic Transition Zones
- Ships must engage spike drives at the solar system's edge, where gravity fades. 
- Transition zones allow entry and exit from metadimensional space.
- Arrival zones are fixed based on a ship's entry path into the system. 
  - Systems can fortify these zones to monitor incoming traffic.
  - Departure zones are flexible; ships can exit undetected from any edge.

## Spike Drills
**Fuel Requirements**: 
  - One load of fuel per drill. Costs 500 credits/load.
  - Ships can refuel at starports, with fuel scoops, or via specialized bunkers.
**Travel Time**: 
  - Transit takes **6 days per hex**, divided by the spike drive rating.
  - Example: A drive-3 moving 2 hexes takes 4 days. 
  - Pilots can "trim the course" to reduce travel time, but at increased risk.
**Course Records (Rutters)**:
  - Recent and accurate rutters reduce difficulty.
  - Blind drills without rutters are extremely dangerous and require a master navigator.
**Skill Checks**:
  - A **Pilot skill check (Int/Pilot)** is required for a successful drill.
  - Base difficulty: 7, modified by rutter quality, distance, rushed activation, or course trimming.

| **Condition**                 | **Difficulty Modifier** |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| No rutter or uncharted course | +6                      |
| Rutter > 5 years old          | +2                      |
| Rutter 1-5 years old          | +1                      |
| Rutter < 1 month old          | -2                      |
| Drill distance (per 2 hexes)  | +1                      |
| Course trimming               | +2                      |
| Rushed activation             | +2                      |



## Intra-System Travel
- **Sub-light Propulsion**:
  - Spike drives are used for travel within a solar system.
  - No significant fuel consumption; no Pilot checks required unless hazards are present.
- **Travel Time**:
  - Within a region: 6 hours.
  - Between regions: 48 hours, divided by spike drive rating.
  - Example: A drive-3 takes 16 hours to cross regions.
- Pilots can trim the course to increase speed but risk doubling the travel time on failure (Pilot check, Difficulty 9).

## Spike Drill Mishaps
- Failed navigation checks can result in the following:

| **Roll** | **Mishap**                                                                              |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3        | Catastrophic failure; ship destroyed within 1d6 hexes of the target system.             |
| 4-5      | Ship returns to origin system; 50% chance systems disabled.                            |
| 6-8      | Power spike; one system disabled, ship delayed for base travel time.                   |
| 9-12     | Ship off course; spend base time in transit, then retry navigation.                    |
| 13-16    | Early detection of off-course travel; retry navigation with no further delay.          |
| 17       | Drill successful but takes double the base time.                                       |
| 18+      | Drill successful and on time.                                                          |

## Key Requirements for Spike Drills
1. **Spike Drive**: Must be rated for the desired hex distance.
2. **Fuel**: At least one load of fuel is required.
3. **Rutter**: Recent, accurate records reduce risk.
4. **Pilot**: A skilled navigator is essential for success.
5. **Location**: Drills can only be initiated at the systemâ€™s edge.

Ensure these conditions are met to maximize safety and efficiency in interstellar travel.
