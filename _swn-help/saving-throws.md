Saving throws are made to resist harmful effects.

| Level | Base Saving Throw Score |
|-------|-------------------------|
| 1     | 15                      |
| 2     | 14                      |
| 3     | 13                      |
| 4     | 12                      |
| 5     | 11                      |
| 6+    | 10 or lower             |

You also add any modifiers you have. For example, if you have Constitution 14, you get +1 on Physical Saves.

### Rolling a Saving Throw
Roll 1d20 and add any attribute modifiers. If the result meets or exceeds the Saving Throw Score, you succeed.

### Types of Saving Throws
- **Physical:** Resists bodily harm (e.g., poisons, disease).
- **Evasion:** Avoids harm (e.g., escaping explosions).
- **Mental:** Resists mental attacks (e.g., fear, mind control).

### Example
If a character is trying to dodge falling debris, they would roll an Evasion save. If their target number for Evasion is 15, they need to roll 15 or higher on a 1d20 to succeed.
