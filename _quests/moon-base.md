Deliver parts to the moonbase in system 7019.

## Notes

Dimitris wants us to deliver some parts to a moonbase inside Letnev space. The base is apparently losing power in some of the lower levels where environmental controls are. 

He mentioned giving us the ship, the *HSS Hyperion*, on a payment plan, as reward...

Gilead managed to convince Velen to look into getting us some hazard pay on top of it.

## Rewards
* HSS Hyperion contract
* Hazard pay (maybe)
